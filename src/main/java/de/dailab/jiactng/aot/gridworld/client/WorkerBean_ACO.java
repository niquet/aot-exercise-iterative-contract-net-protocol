    In ACO, a set of software agents called artificial ants search for good solutions to a given optimization problem.
    To apply ACO, the optimization problem is transformed into the problem of finding the best path on a weighted graph.
    The artificial ants (hereafter ants) incrementally build solutions by moving on the graph. The solution construction
    process is stochastic and is biased by a pheromone model, that is, a set of parameters associated with graph
    components (either nodes or edges) whose values are modified at runtime by the ants.

    TODO
    - Search space defined over a finite set of discrete decision variables;
    - Set of constraints among the variables; and
    - Objective function to be minimized (as maximizing over f is the same as minimizing over âˆ’f , every Combinatorial
      Optimization Problem can be described as a minimization problem)
