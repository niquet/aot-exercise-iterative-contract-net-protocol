# A-Star-Java-Implementation
A* also called A Star, algorithm java implementation

This is a java implementation of the A Star algorithm. I couldn't find any good java implementations of this famous AI algorithm on the web so I decided to make my own. 

The implementation includes 3 files:
  - AStar.java : Main algorithm class.
  - Node.java : Class for the nodes used by the algorithm.
  - AStarTest.java : Class with a main method and a simple test for the algorithm implementation
